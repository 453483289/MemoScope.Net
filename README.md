# Thanks to...

* Lee Culver for his [ClrMd](https://github.com/Microsoft/clrmd) library, without it, MemoScope.Net would not exist.
* FatCow for their free [icons](http://www.fatcow.com/free-icons)
* Phillip Piper for [ObjectListView](http://objectlistview.sourceforge.net/cs/index.html). With it, it's so easy  to display tables and trees.
* [DockPanelSuite](http://dockpanelsuite.com/) contributors for their docking library
* Rupert Avery for [C# Expression Evaluator](https://csharpeval.codeplex.com/)
* Jeff Cyr for [ClrMd.Extensions](https://github.com/JeffCyr/ClrMD.Extensions), even if I don't use it, I learnt a lot reading the source code (and I copy/pasted the ClrObject class !)
